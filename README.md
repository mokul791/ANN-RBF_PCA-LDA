# ANN-RBF_PCA-LDA


Breast Cancer is the most diagnosed disease among women. Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer can significantly reduce the suffering and death count. In this work, the Radial Basis Function Neural Network is used as a classifier to predict the benign and malignant cases. RBFNN has a shallow architecture with a radial basis function that performs a nonlinear transformation, by mapping nonlinearity into a high-dimensional domain and making the data linearly separable. Wisconsin dataset on breast cancer diagnosis is used for the study. Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis were used independently for dimension reduction of the dataset before feeding into two different classifiers with RFBNN. This work shows that without any data dimensionality reduction, RBFNN performs poor as a classifier (Accuracy 90%). Implementation of both PCA and LDA improves the performance of the classification model, but the LDA-RBFNN model (accuracy 97%) outperforms the PCA-RBFNN (accuracy 94%) for the classification task.
